# Velvet-Rs

This package implements Velvet Noise Convolution, based on the paper [Late-Reverberation Synthesis Using Interleaved Velvet-Noise Sequences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9360485) by V. Välimäki and K. Prawda.

It also includes traditional FFT-based and naive convolution methods for comparison.
